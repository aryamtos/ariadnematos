## 📚 Publications
- **[Accent Classification is Challenging but Pre-training Helps: a case study with novel Brazilian Portuguese datasets](https://aclanthology.org/2024.propor-1.37.pdf)** -  This paper evaluates accent classification for spontaneous speech using CNN-LSTM networks and the Wav2vec2 model. We study the importance of dataset size, pre-trained models, and external validation. For that we used 90 hours of data, encompassing 9 accents and involving 204 speakers of Brazilian Portuguese, obtained from manually annotated subsets from Spotify Podcasts 1
and CORAA ASR
- **[Extração de Características de Imagens Mamográficas Baseada em Técnicas de Aprendizado Profundo](https://sol.sbc.org.br/index.php/sbcas_estendido/article/view/20501/20328)** - Custom convolutional neural network with regularization techniques for automatic feature extraction from mammographic images.
